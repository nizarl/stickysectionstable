 When your repo is created and you have access to it , the following steps needs to be done 
 
 1. There are configuration files which contain APP NAME wording (CI.properties, application.properties, sonar.properties, jboss-web.xml) . Replace then with 
 your App Name 
 2. update the CI.properties with your or your teams email address . This is needed for your CI effort 
 6. There are some file called "removeme" . This was created because GIT will not create a repo with empty directories . 
 As a result empty files needed to be put in them. please remove them as needed
